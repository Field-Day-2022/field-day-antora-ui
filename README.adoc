This project is a customized version of the Antora Default UI, tailored for the Field Day documentation site. It provides branding, navigation updates, and enhanced features specific to Field Day's needs.

[NOTE]
====
Field Day is developed by ASU software engineering students as a capstone project. While not officially affiliated with Arizona State University, this UI adheres to ASU's branding guidelines to maintain a professional and cohesive representation. Refer to the {url-asubrand}[ASU branding guidelines] for more details.
====

== Use the Field Day UI

To use this customized UI for your Antora-generated site, add the following UI configuration to your Antora playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/Field-Day-2022/field-day-antora-ui/releases/latest/download/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true

runtime:
  fetch: true
----

NOTE: The `snapshot` flag ensures that Antora fetches the UI bundle when the `--fetch` command-line flag is used. The `runtime.fetch` option ensures the latest bundle is retrieved.
